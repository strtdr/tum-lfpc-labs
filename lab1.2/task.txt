Compiler Design Task due on 18.02.2020
Define syntax of your programming languages and compute sample code which consist of 2 functions, first main function and second function which performs some computations. Sample should include call of second function from main function.
Define grammar of your programming language. Grammar should include sets of terminal and non-terminal symbols, and rules of derivation.
Write a program which will perform tokenization of your sample code, in other words write basic lexer of your programming language.
